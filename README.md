# NeuralNetworks
Gaining an understanding of neural networks and basic ML principles


To compile use the ./compile.sh script in the NeuralNetworks dir

To run use the ./run.sh script in the NeuralNetworks dir

The mainBackProp.cpp file is run with these scripts and shows an example
of backpropagation used to train a neural network that can identify hand written
digits. The data used can be found from the MNIST dataset, and the project follows
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html which implements the same
principles in python.
