# NeuralNetworks
Gaining an understanding of neural networks and basic ML principles


To compile use the ./compile.sh script in the NeuralNetworks dir

To run use the ./run.sh script in the NeuralNetworks dir

Make sure to uncompress the zipped data files first
in neural-networks-and-deep-learning-master/data dir

The mainBackProp.cpp file is run with these scripts and shows an example
of backpropagation used to train a neural network that can identify hand written
digits. The data used can be found from the MNIST dataset, and the project follows
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html which implements the same
principles in python.


# TODO
Need to add a script to install Graphic lib and eigen, also might as well unzip the CSVs
Need to add if statements to the CMake to be able to compile different main files
