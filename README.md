# NeuralNetworks
Gaining an understanding of neural networks and basic ML principles


To compile use the ./compile.sh script in the NeuralNetworks dir
To run use the ./run.sh script in the NeuralNetworks dir

The output is 5x expected data vs untrained network data
Followed by 5x expected data vs trained network data

The output clearly shows a strong improvement and the trained
data is close enough to the expected data that I am confident
to say that the network is working as intended.
