# NeuralNetworks
Gaining an understanding of neural networks and basic ML principles


To compile use the ./compile.sh script in the NeuralNetworks dir

To run use the ./run.sh script in the NeuralNetworks dir

Currently working on controlling a simulated drone using a neural network
by tuning it using a genetic algorithm.

Ideas to implement:
	- For running the system N number of drones shall be run for X counts
	- Counts will increase by 1 each update
	- The score is how many targets get hit
	- The ones that achieve the highest targets will be kept altered slightly and re-run
